# MicroQuiz: Smart Quiz Generator from Lecture Notes

## Summary
MicroQuiz transforms your lecture materials into personalized quizzes instantly. It extracts knowledge from slides, notes, or even handwritten content, generates tailored multiple-choice and true/false questions at various difficulty levels, identifies gaps in your notes, and supplements missing content based on your curriculum. Study smarter, not harder!

## Background
MicroQuiz addresses several key challenges faced by students and educators:

* **Information Overload**: Students often struggle to identify key concepts from extensive lecture materials, making studying inefficient
* **Personalized Learning Gaps**: Traditional study methods don't adapt to individual knowledge gaps
* **Incomplete Notes**: Students frequently miss important information during lectures
* **Content Accessibility**: Handwritten notes and PDF materials are difficult to convert into actionable study tools
* **Curriculum Alignment**: Self-study materials often don't align perfectly with specific course requirements

## How is it used?

MicroQuiz simplifies the study process through these key features:

1. **Upload your learning materials**: Drag and drop lecture slides, typed notes, or take a photo of handwritten notes

2. **Automatic content processing**: OCR technology extracts and processes text from any source
   
3. **Generate customized quizzes**: Select difficulty level and question types (multiple-choice, true/false)
   
    ```rust
    // This is sample code. Not for Production!
    fn generate_quiz(content: &str, difficulty: &str, question_types: Vec<&str>) -> Vec<String> {
        let concepts = extract_key_concepts(content);
        let mut questions = Vec::new();
        
        for concept in concepts {
            if question_types.contains(&"multiple_choice") {
                questions.push(generate_mc_question(&concept, difficulty));
            }
            if question_types.contains(&"true_false") {
                questions.push(generate_tf_question(&concept, difficulty));
            }
        }
        
        questions
    }
   ```

4. **Identify and fill knowledge gaps**: MicroQuiz analyzes your notes against curriculum standards and suggests content for missing sections

5. **Curriculum plugin selection**: Choose from community-contributed curriculum plugins for specialized content


MicroQuiz is ideal for:
* Students preparing for exams
* Educators creating quick assessments
* Self-learners validating their understanding
* Study groups collaborating on shared materials

## Data sources and AI methods

MicroQuiz uses a combination of data sources and AI techniques:

| Data Source | Purpose |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| User-provided notes/slides | Primary content for quiz generation |
| Curriculum plugins | Reference standards for identifying gaps |
| Open educational resources | Supplementary content for missing sections |

The AI methods employed include:

* **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: Converts images of text into machine-readable text
* **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**: Analyzes text to identify key concepts and relationships
* **Knowledge Graph**: Maps relationships between concepts to generate appropriate questions
* **Generative AI**: Creates missing content sections and formulates questions with plausible distractors

The application is built with Rust for performance and reliability, leveraging the OpenCV crate for image processing capabilities.

## Challenges

While MicroQuiz offers significant benefits, it has limitations:

* **Content Quality Dependency**: The quality of generated quizzes depends on the quality and completeness of the input materials
* **Subject Limitations**: The system works best with fact-based subjects and may struggle with highly interpretive or creative fields
* **Language Constraints**: Initial versions may have limited support for non-English content
* **Privacy Considerations**: Processing educational materials raises questions about data privacy and intellectual property

Ethical considerations include:
* Ensuring generated content doesn't reproduce biases present in source materials
* Maintaining academic integrity by focusing on understanding rather than rote memorization
* Providing transparency about AI-generated vs. original content

## What next?

MicroQuiz has several promising avenues for growth:

* **Interactive Learning Paths**: Develop adaptive learning sequences based on quiz performance
* **Collaborative Features**: Enable group study with shared question banks
* **Multimodal Support**: Extend beyond text to incorporate diagrams, graphs, and mathematical expressions
* **Integration with LMS**: Connect with learning management systems for streamlined educational workflows
* **Mobile Application**: Create dedicated mobile apps for on-the-go studying

To achieve these goals, we would benefit from:
* Partnerships with educational institutions for testing and validation
* Collaboration with curriculum experts to expand plugin offerings
* Extended AI research to improve content generation quality
* User experience designers to optimize the learning interface
