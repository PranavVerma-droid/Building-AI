Suppose we also happen to know the gender of the lottery winner. Here are same OECD statistics as above broken down by gender:
Country 	Population 	Male fishers 	Female fishers 	Fishers (total)
Denmark 	5,615,000 	1822 	69 	1891
Finland 	5,439,000 	2575 	77 	2652
Iceland 	324,000 	3400 	400 	3800
Norway 	5,080,000 	11,291 	320 	11,611
Sweden 	9,609,000 	1731 	26 	1757
TOTAL 	26,067,000 	20,819 	892 	21,711

Write a function that uses the above numbers and tries to guess the nationality of the winner when we know that the winner is a fisher and their gender (either female or male).

The argument of the function should be the gender of the winner ('female' or 'male'). The return value of the function should be a pair (country, probability) where country is the most likely nationality of the winner and probability is the probability of the country being the nationality of the winner. 

Output Example
if the winner is male, my guess is he's from Finland; probability 08.56%
if the winner is female, my guess is she's from Norway; probability 23.98%

Tip: Your values might be different, but the formatting should be identical.
