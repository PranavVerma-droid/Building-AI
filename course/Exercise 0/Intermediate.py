"""
The intermediate exercise involve coding: either so that you get to modify existing code and write your own, or in a few cases, answer multiple choice quizzes involving code examples.

Remember that you can move freely between the difficulty levels. If the intermediate exercise seems difficult, you can do the Beginner exercise first. Sometimes solving the Beginner exercise may help you understand the idea and get going with the coding exercises. Having completed an Intermediate exercise, you can challenge yourself and give the Advanced exercise a go! You can also return to it later at any time.

Let's first learn how the coding exercises are done and submitted. Go ahead and experiment with the code editor below. You can't break it! This exercise doesn't give you points, so you don't have to worry about losing any points.


The Reset below the code window enable you to reset the code back to square one. The initial code in the code window often contains a partial solution.

The Run button runs the code. If your code contains any print statements, you should see the output in the separate 'Output' window (see below). Any error messages will also be displayed there. Be prepared for a small delay when you click Run for the first time as your browser sets up the coding environment.
